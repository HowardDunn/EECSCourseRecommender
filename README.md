# EECSCourseRecommender

This project was built using CodeBlocks, as of this commit, the code is messy and needs further documentation.

This project was created for practice with classes and vectors. It uses course.cpp to create the course class and useful algorithms are found in course_algorithms.cpp.

The program reads your courses from "courses.txt" then gives you a recommendation of which EECS courses you should take based on enforced requirements, advisory requirements and corequisites.
